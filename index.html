           <p>For my expert demonstration I’ll be discussing how to properly kite a paraglider, which is integral to flying safely in all conditions.
              Kiting for takeoff is dangerous because it is one of two times, landing being the other, when you are close to what can actually hurt you, the ground.
             Therefore proper technique and practice are crucial to the sport.
             <br><br>For this application I’ll explain the process as if I was trying to teach a beginner.
             We’ll already assume that the learner is familiar with the basic parts of the paraglider and associated equipment and that the harness is connected to the gilder properly, which is a whole other topic.
             We will also assume we have a perfect amount of wind for a beginner which is between 5-8 mph with no gusting.
             <br><br>The first step when getting ready to kite a paraglider is to make sure the lines are clear.
             Lay the glider out flat on the ground across the take off area,
             with the cells pointing straight into the wind if possible so it can rise without getting pulled from side to side due to cross winds.
           </p>

            A common recreational glider will consist of four sets of lines called A through D and colored coded.
            A lines (red on my glider) are at the leading edge, or front.
            B lines (blue on my glider) and C lines (green on my glider) are found connected to the middle of the glider.
            And the D lines (yellow on my glider), also known as the brake lines, are at the trailing edge, or rear and have toggles for control.
            <br><br>Take each set of lines starting with the A’s and pull them up just enough to make sure they aren’t tangled with any other lines.
            If you pull the lines too much or too aggressive you could engage the leading edge and the wing could inflate unexpectedly.
            After the A lines are clear check the B and C lines to a make sure they are clear as well.
            This is made easier by continuing to hold the previous lines up as well when checking lower lines.
            The D lines, which are on the bottom, will be clear by virtue of the other lines being cleared.

          <p>
            After the lines have been checked the next step is to build a wall with the paraglider.
            Building a wall is crucial because it gives you the chance to make sure the wing is going straight into the wind and will have a clean inflation, so it doesn’t pull the pilot or surge in an undesired direction.
            When the pilot is facing towards the wing to build his/her wall the lines will be crossed because they are straight when the pilot is in flying position looking away from the glider.
            It is best to keep the dominant hand side of the lines on top, in my case right side on top and left on bottom, for ease when kiting. The pilot, with his harness on and connected to the glider, will walk away from the glider in reverse to where the lines just start to become taught.
            <br><br>Next the pilot will grab the two brakes, right brake in the right hand and left brake in the left hand, which are used as a “kill switch” if things aren’t going as planned.
            With the brakes in hand the next thing to do is grab the A lines and pull up on them until the leading edge begins to take in a little air.
            This is only a very small amount of pull and with higher winds can be done without the A line assistance at all.
            Once you get a little air into the glider you simply use the basic tension you get by having the lines being taught and walk forward or backwards to create more or less wall.
            The pilot must be careful as to not walk to far back or the wing could receive too much air and inflate prematurely.
            If the wing isn’t inflated evenly across itself this is more than likely because he/she isn’t straight into the wind. The pilot can step left or right while keeping tension on the lines to find the spot where the wind is straight in.
            Once the wing appears to have about a third of its width filled with air and evenly across the whole wing you’re ready for the final step.

           <p>
          To finally kite the wing you’ll grab both A lines and hold them together with your dominant hand. With your non dominant hand you’ll then grab both C lines.
          The point of this is to use the A lines to get air into the cells of wing and have it inflate while using the C lines to brake or dampen the speed at which the wing goes into kiting position.

            You want to lift the A lines up opposed to pulling them up and towards you, which is a common beginner mistake.
            If you pull to quick or aggressively with the A’s then the wing could overshoot and fall in front of you, which could be dangerous on a cliff flying site, but if you pull too little then the wing won’t inflate.
            I’d say 85% of my energy in terms of tension is focused on the A’s and 15% on the C’s if the winds are between 5-8mph with no gusting.
            Once the wing is directly above you it’s best to let go of both A and C lines and kite the wing with the D line, brakes, in your hands.
            If the wing sags to one side you walk towards the sagging side while pulling on the brake of the higher side to balance out the wing.
            The goal is to always try and keep the wing directly above you. This can be done for as long as needed until the pilot is comfortable for takeoff.

             Remember, the above advice is meant to teach someone who has never spent anytime paragliding before.
             Once you introduce different wind speeds along with varying terrain (coastal, mountain, sand dunes, etc.) there are plenty of small tweaks and adjustments one will need to use to adapt to each condition and area.
              This advice is crucial for how most novice pilots will spend a majority of their time training, on the ground trying to keep their wing directly above their head.
             <br><br>Here are a couple of real life scenarios where I've flown to get a feel for how it works in action.<br>
